## Graduate students

I am actively seeking graduate students to join my group with start dates in Fall 2019.  Prospective students are encouraged to apply for admission to our [doctoral program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate-students).  
[//]: # (Due to the number of inquiries, I cannot reply to individual requests concerning graduate admissions; I plan to arrange phone or video calls with a subset of candidates after reviewing applications.)

## Student intern

My group has an opening for a (paid) intern to develop and maintain a website that provides information on the 
rainfall variability that affects billions of people living in tropical countries:
http://WorldMonsoons.org.  The exact nature of this position will depend on the expertise and 
interests of the candidate, and could range from simple web development/maintenance tasks to creation and
management of complex algorithms that ingest and display large geophysical datasets.


## Postdoctoral scientist for Department of Energy project

The research group of Prof. William Boos at UC Berkeley is seeking a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand and/or predict weather and climate.  Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered (e.g. those coming from the field of statistics with little experience in the earth sciences).  The position is part of a new project funded by the US Department of Energy titled “Monsoon Extremes:  Impacts, Metrics, and Synoptic-Scale Drivers”, and the postdoc will work as part of a team with scientists from the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://eesa.lbl.gov/our-divisions/climate-ecosystem-sciences/) and [UC Davis](http://lawr.ucdavis.edu).  The goal of the project is improve understanding of the causes of extreme monsoon rainfall, including extremes in the North American monsoon, and to develop process-based statistical projections of variations in precipitation extremes.

The appointment will be in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](http://eps.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) with an initial term of one year; the expectation is that progress would merit reappointment for a second year or more.  A Ph.D. or equivalent in a relevant field is required by the start date.  Starting salary is commensurate with experience.  UC Berkeley has an excellent benefits package and a number of policies and programs in place to support employees as they balance work and family.

The University of California is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, age, or protected veteran status. For the complete University of California nondiscrimination and affirmative action policy see: http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000376/NondiscrimAffirmAct 

The position will remain open until filled.  Questions regarding the position can be directed to William Boos at william.boos@berkeley.edu.  Complete applications include a cover letter, CV, and brief (1 page) statement of research interests; references will be requested at a later stage in the process.  Informal inquiries are welcome, although we do not have the capacity to respond to all queries.

## Postdoctoral scientist for Monsoon Mission project

The research group of Prof. William Boos at UC Berkeley is seeking a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in statistics and atmospheric dynamics.  The position is part of a new project funded by India’s Monsoon Mission titled “Dynamical metrics for predicting genesis and growth of monsoon low pressure systems”.  The postdoc will work as part of a team with scientists from the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://eesa.lbl.gov/our-divisions/climate-ecosystem-sciences/) and [UC Davis](http://lawr.ucdavis.edu).  The goal of the project is improve understanding and predictions of transient vortices in the South Asian monsoon, the precipitation extremes they produce, and their interaction with the seasonal-mean, continental-scale monsoon flow.

The appointment will be in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](http://eps.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) with an initial term of one year and the expectation that progress would merit reappointment for a second year or more.  A Ph.D. or equivalent in a relevant field is required by the start date.  Starting salary is commensurate with experience.
