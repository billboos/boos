## Graduate students

I am actively seeking graduate students to join my group to start in Fall 2019.  Prospective students are encouraged to apply for admission to our [doctoral program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate-students).  
[//]: # (Due to the number of inquiries, I cannot reply to individual requests concerning graduate admissions; I plan to arrange phone or video calls with a subset of candidates after reviewing applications.)

## Student interns

My group has an opening for a (paid) intern to develop and maintain a website that provides information on the 
rainfall variability that affects billions of people living in tropical countries:
http://WorldMonsoons.com.  The exact nature of this position will depend on the expertise and 
interests of the candidate, and could range from simple web development/maintenance tasks to creation and
management of complex algorithms that ingest and display large geophysical datasets.


[//]: # (## Postdoctoral scientist)

[//]: # (My group has an opening for a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand and/or predict weather and climate.  Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered (e.g. those coming from the field of statistics with little to no experience in the earth sciences, or vice versa).  The position involves using newly available observations and innovative theoretical frameworks to build statistical models of tropical rainfall, with the goal of advancing understanding and prediction of hydrological variability on a range of time scales.  The exact focus of the work will depend on the candidate's background and interests, but could center on atmospheric vortices and waves in monsoon regions (including Asia, Africa, and the Americas), the extreme rainfall they produce, and perhaps their human impacts. )
[//]: # (The appointment will be in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](http://eps.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu), with an initial term of one year and the expectation that progress would merit reappointment for a second year or more.  A Ph.D. or equivalent in a relevant field is required by the start date.  Starting salary is commensurate with experience.  UC Berkeley has an excellent benefits package and a number of policies and programs in place to support employees as they balance work and family.)

[//]: # (The position will remain open until filled.  Questions regarding the position can be directed to William Boos at william.boos@berkeley.edu.  Complete applications include a cover letter, CV, and brief (1 page) statement of research interests; references will be requested at a later stage in the process.  Informal inquiries are welcome, although we do not have the capacity to respond to all queries.)
