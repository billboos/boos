## Postdoctoral scientist

My group has an opening for a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand
and/or predict weather
and climate.  The position involves using newly available observations and innovative theoretical 
frameworks to build statistical models of tropical rainfall, with the goal of advancing understanding and
prediction of hydrological variability on a range of time scales.  The exact focus of the work will
depend on the candidate's background and interests, but could center on 
atmospheric vortices and waves in monsoon regions (including Asia, Africa, and the Americas), the extreme
rainfall they produce, and perhaps 
their human impacts.
The appointment will be in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](http://eps.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu), with an initial term of
one year and the expectation that progress would merit reappointment for a second year.  A Ph.D. or equivalent in a relevant field is 
required by the start date.  Starting salary is commensurate with experience.
UC Berkeley has an excellent benefits package and a number of policies and programs in place to support 
employees as they balance work and family.

The University of California is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, age, or protected veteran status. For the complete University of California nondiscrimination and affirmative action policy see: http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000376/NondiscrimAffirmAct

The position will remain open until filled.  Questions regarding the position can be directed to William 
Boos at william.boos@berkeley.edu.  Complete applications include a cover letter, CV, and brief (1 page) 
statement of research interests; references will be requested at a later stage in the process.
Informal inquiries are welcome, although we do not have the capacity to
respond to all queries.


## Graduate students

I am actively seeking graduate students to join my group.  Prospective students are encouraged to apply
for admission to our [doctoral program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate-students).

## Undergraduate interns

My group has multiple openings for undergraduate interns.

The most immediate need is for a web 
developer to assist in updating and maintaining a site that provides information on the tropical
rainfall variability that affects billions of people living in tropical countries:
http://WorldMonsoons.com.  The exact nature of this position will depend on the expertise and 
interests of the candidate, and could range from simple web development tasks to creation and
management of complex algorithms that ingest and display large geophysical datasets.

I am also seeking an intern to assist with minor updates and extensions of this research website.

Students interested in conducting research in tropical climate dynamics are encouraged to contact me.
Positions are available in numerical modeling and data analysis.  Candidates must have experience
working in a Linux computing environment and using either Python, Matlab, or similar data analysis
language.
