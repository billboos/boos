title= "Surface flux feedbacks in idealized simulations of tropical depression spinup"
date= "2017-07-16"
abstract= "An idealized, three-dimensional, cloud-system resolving model is used to investigate the role of surface enthalpy flux feedbacks during tropical depression (TD) spinup, an early stage of tropical cyclogenesis in which the role of surface fluxes has not been well examined. A wide range of simulations supports the hypothesis that a negative radial gradient of surface enthalpy flux is necessary for TD spinup but can arise from multiple mechanisms. The negative radial gradient is typically created by the wind speed-dependence of surface enthalpy fluxes, consistent with previous theories for tropical cyclone intensification. However, when surface enthalpy fluxes are prescribed to be independent of wind speed, spinup still occurs, albeit more slowly, with the negative radial gradient of surface enthalpy flux maintained by an enhanced air-sea thermodynamic disequilibrium beneath the cold-core of the incipient vortex. The distinction between surface latent and sensible heat fluxes is unimportant during TD spinup; suppressing all latent heat flux while increasing the sensible heat flux to maintain roughly the same net enthalpy flux produces a rate of intensification nearly identical to that of the control. Surface enthalpy flux feedbacks seem to be more important for intensification than the vortex initial state. For example, a vortex does form and intensify even from a state of rest when the center of the domain is initialized to be nearly saturated with water vapor, but this intensification is modest in amplitude and transient, lasting less than 12 hours, without interactive surface enthaply flux."
