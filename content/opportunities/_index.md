### Graduate student positions

A graduate student position will be available in the research group of William Boos at UC Berkeley, with start date in Fall 2020.  This position is not tied to any particular project, and candidates are encouraged to think broadly and ambitiously about possible thesis topics.  Interested students with strong quantitative backgrounds are encouraged to apply for admission to the [doctoral program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate-students) of the Department of Earth and Planetary Science. 
[//]: # (Due to the number of inquiries, I cannot reply to individual requests concerning graduate admissions; I plan to arrange phone or video calls with a subset of candidates after reviewing applications.)


[//]: # (### **A new research partnership on monsoon precipitation** )
 
[//]: # (A new multi-institutional effort to improve understanding and prediction of monsoon rainfall will launch in Fall 2018.  This effort is a partnership between [William Boos](http://boos.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, [Travis O’Brien](https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/travis-a-obrien) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and [Paul Ullrich](https://climate.ucdavis.edu) at UC Davis.  Multiple job opportunities are available across several projects, in addition to traditional graduate student positions.)

[//]: # (### Postdoctoral scientist:  Extreme events in the North American and Asian monsoons)
 
[//]: # (The research group of William Boos at UC Berkeley is seeking a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand and/or predict weather and climate. Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered, including those coming from the field of statistics with little experience in the earth sciences. The position is part of a new project aimed at understanding the causes of extreme rainfall in the North American and South Asian monsoons, and developing process-based statistical projections of variations in these extremes.)
 
[//]: # (The appointment will be in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](http://eps.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) with an initial term of one year and the expectation that progress would merit reappointment for a second year or more.  A Ph.D. or equivalent in a relevant field is required by the start date. Starting salary is commensurate with experience.  UC Berkeley has an excellent benefits package and a number of policies and programs in place to support employees as they balance work and family.)

[//]: # (This position will remain open until filled.  Applications and questions regarding the position can be directed to William Boos at william.boos@berkeley.edu.  Complete applications include a cover letter, CV, and brief (1 page) statement of research interests; references will be requested at a later stage in the process. Informal inquiries are welcome, although we do not have the capacity to respond to all queries.)
 
[//]: # (### Postdoctoral scientist:  India’s Monsoon Mission)
 
[//]: # ( The research group of William Boos at UC Berkeley seeks a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in statistics and atmospheric dynamics. Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered, including those coming from the field of statistics with little experience in the earth sciences. The position is part of a new project funded by India’s Monsoon Mission titled “Dynamical metrics for predicting genesis and growth of monsoon low pressure systems”.  The project aims to improve understanding and predictions of transient vortices in the South Asian monsoon, the precipitation extremes they produce, and their interaction with the seasonal-mean, continental-scale monsoon flow.)

[//]: # (## Postdoctoral scientist)

[//]: # (My group has an opening for a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand and/or predict weather and climate.  Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered (e.g. those coming from the field of statistics with little to no experience in the earth sciences, or vice versa).  The position involves using newly available observations and innovative theoretical frameworks to build statistical models of tropical rainfall, with the goal of advancing understanding and prediction of hydrological variability on a range of time scales.  The exact focus of the work will depend on the candidate's background and interests, but could center on atmospheric vortices and waves in monsoon regions (including Asia, Africa, and the Americas), the extreme rainfall they produce, and perhaps their human impacts. )
